        As global travel returned after the pandemic, aviation quickly surged back toward pre-COVID activity. But the recovery wasn’t even across countries. Some regions rebounded faster, while others remained far below their 2019 traffic levels. This uneven return shows up clearly when we look at the environmental impact of aviation today. Before understanding how the pandemic changed aircraft fleets or flight volumes, it’s important to first see which countries contributed most to aviation emissions in 2024—a snapshot of who came back strongest, and who stayed grounded. That is why our journey starts with a look at which countries produced the most aviation emissions in 2024.

        <p class="transition-body">
          Simply seeing emissions by country reveals which regions recovered fastest, but it doesn’t show the magnitude of the pandemic’s impact. For that, we need to look at how flight activity collapsed and then rebounded over time. By comparing total flights in January 2019 (before the pandemic), April 2020 (global shutdown), and December 2022 (partial recovery), we can see just how dramatically the skies changed — and how slowly they began to reopen.

        <p class="transition-body">
          The sharp drop in total flights shows how severely the industry was hit — but the recovery that followed was far from smooth. Even by late 2022, many regions were still operating below pre-pandemic levels, and airlines were forced to rebuild cautiously. With demand fluctuating and long-haul routes recovering slowly, the global fleet never returned to its old balance. This is why the next step is to look at which aircraft models were actually flying during this period.

          Understanding which aircraft dominated the skies sets the stage for exploring where they actually flew. Routes were cut, reopened, or permanently reshaped as countries navigated lockdowns and recovery. The interactive globe brings this transformation to life, letting you discover how global air routes shifted and how the pandemic permanently altered the world’s flight network in detail.

        <p class="transition-body">
          The pandemic did more than temporarily ground flights—it rewired how, where, and with what aircraft we travel. Emissions by country showed that some regions surged back toward pre-COVID activity while others remained far below their 2019 levels, revealing an uneven and asymmetric recovery.
        </p>

        <p class="transition-body">
          The timeline of total flights across key months made the scale of disruption visible: a steep collapse in 2020 followed by a slow, incomplete rebound. At the same time, the mix of aircraft models shifted, as airlines leaned on more efficient jets and reshaped their fleets to cope with uncertain demand.
        </p>

        <p class="transition-body">
          Finally, the interactive globe revealed how routes themselves changed—some restored, some rerouted, some disappearing altogether. Taken together, these views show that today’s sky is not just a return to “normal”, but a new geography of air service shaped by the shock of COVID-19.
        </p>

        <p class="transition-body">
          As you explore, consider not only how far aviation has come back, but also who still remains less connected—and how future crises might redraw the map of global travel again.
